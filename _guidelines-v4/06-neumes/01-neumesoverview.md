The following four elements are the fundamental components of the Neumes Module:

{% include desc elem="syllable" %}
{% include desc elem="syl" %}
{% include desc elem="neume" %}
{% include desc elem="nc" %}

Most neume notation is used to set music to an existing text. The syllable is the fundamental unit of structure, with the neumes themselves serving as a means of “sonifying” the text. A syllable may be expressed via one or more neumes, with the particular neume shape chosen to depend on the pitch contour that is being employed and the desired interpretation. 
The {% include link elem="syllable" %} element is used as the primary organizational element for neume notation within a {% include link elem="layer" %} element. Within {% include link elem="syllable" %}, the {% include link elem="syl" %} element defined in the MEI.shared module is used for encoding the textual content, while the {% include link elem="neume" %} and {% include link elem="nc" %} elements are used to encode the neumes themselves. Within these neume module elements, other standard MEI mechanisms are available to accommodate, for example, editorial or critical markup.

{% include link elem="neume" %} 
: consists of one or more {% include link elem="nc" %} element(s): 

{% include figure img="modules/neumes/NEUME-con.png" %} (connected) 

{% include figure img="modules/neumes/NEUME-non-con.png" %} (non-connected)

{% include link elem="nc" %} 
: neume component is a single-pitched event, although the exact pitch may not be known.

{% include figure img="modules/neumes/nc-example-1.png" %}

{% include figure img="modules/neumes/nc-example-2.png" %}

{% include figure img="modules/neumes/nc-example-3.png" %}
